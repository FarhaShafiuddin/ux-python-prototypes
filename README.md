# UX + Python Prototypes

This repository contains UX-focused prototypes built with Python.  
My work emphasizes usability, accessibility, and clear interaction design rather than complex algorithms.

I am a computer science student focusing on **UI/UX design and Python development**, with an interest in creating interfaces that are inclusive, intuitive, and user-centered.

## Project: Accessible Form Prototype

**Tools:** Python, Tkinter  
**Focus:** Accessibility, clarity, error prevention, user guidance

### Problem
Forms are a common source of user frustration. Poor labeling, unclear requirements, and unhelpful error messages can make even simple tasks difficult—especially for users with accessibility needs.

### UX Goals
- Clear instructions and labels  
- Logical tab order and keyboard accessibility  
- Readable fonts and simple layout  
- Immediate, understandable feedback for user input  

### Solution
This prototype demonstrates an accessible form built in Python using Tkinter. The design prioritizes:
- Simple visual hierarchy  
- Explicit field labels  
- User-friendly validation messages  
- Reduced cognitive load  

### Why This Matters
Accessibility and usability are not add-ons—they are core design requirements. This project reflects my approach to UX: thoughtful, inclusive, and grounded in real user needs.
