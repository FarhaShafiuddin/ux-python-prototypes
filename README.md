## Accessible Form Prototype - Python UX Project
This project demonstrates my ability to design a user-friendly, accessible form using Python. The goal was to create 
an interface that is clear, intuitive, and usable for all users, including those with accessibility challenges.

### UX Problem
Forms can be confusing or frustrating if labels aren't clear, required fields aren't obvious, or error
messages are unhelpful. This project addresses these issues by providing clear instructions, inline validation, and
accessible design choices.

### Approach
I planned the form layout, designed clear labels and buttons, and implemented real-time validation to guide
users. The project emphasizes accessibility with readable fonts, logical tab order, and clear error messages.

### Result
- Clear and concise labels
- Immediate feedback on errors
- Logical tab order and keyboard navigation
- High-contrast color scheme for readability

### Next Steps
I plan to expand the prototype with more input types and integrate user testing feedback to further improve usability.
